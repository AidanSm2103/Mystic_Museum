# Mystic Museum

Mystic Museum is an atmospheric, interactive website built as a personal learning project focused on front-end fundamentals, state management, and immersive design. The site presents a fictional museum of mystical artifacts that react to user interaction and persist their state across pages.

---

## ✦ Project Overview

The Mystic Museum allows users to explore a collection of mysterious artifacts. Certain actions will unlock artifacts, making them visible in their exhibits. These changes persist across page navigation using browser storage, allowing for continuity and progression. The goal of this project was not to create a large application, but to build a polished, cohesive experience while reinforcing best practices in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✦ Features

- Interactive runes that unlock artifacts.
- Persistent artifact states using local storage.
- Dynamic image swapping without page reloads.
- A thematic reset mechanic that restores the museum to its original state.
- Custom scrollbar styling.
- Subtle animations and visual feedback.
- Fully client-side — no frameworks, no libraries.

## ✦ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3** — Layout, animations, filters, and UI styling.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — DOM manipulation, event handling, and state persistence.
- **GitHub Pages** — Deployment and hosting.

## ✦ Image Creation & Tools

The artifact illustrations in Mystic Museum were created with the assistance of AI image-generation tools and then curated, edited, and integrated manually into the site. AI was used strictly as a visual aid for concept and asset generation, not for application logic or site structure.

## ✦ Design Philosophy

Mystic Museum was designed around the following core principles:

- **Minimal JavaScript**: Only use JS where it meaningfully improves interaction.
- **State over spectacle**: Progression and persistence matter more than flashy effects.
- **Atmosphere first**: Visual choices support the narrative rather than distract from it.
- **Intentional limitations**: Features were added only when they served the project.

## ✦ Known Limitations

- This project does not include a backend or database.
- Progress is stored locally and does not sync between devices.
- Designed primarily for desktop viewing.

These constraints are aligned with the project’s learning goals and intended scope.
