        <h2 class="about-heading">Our Founder</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            Our founder, Dr. Archie Lockheart was a renowned historian, mystic and occultist. 
            Dr. Lockheart has spent his life uncovering the secrets that lie beyond the veil. 
            He tragically passed away in 1969 under mysterious circumstances, police ruled suicide but many believe there was more to the story.

        <h2 class="about-heading">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="about-text">Preserve those that came before us. Protect those that come after us.</p>

        <h2 class="about-heading">Runes</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            Our artifacts contain great power, for this reason they have been placed under a protective spell.
            Those with a keen eye may find the correct runes to lift the spell and behold our great artifacts.
